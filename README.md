# MFGJ
A puzzle platformer with a "partial reset" mechanic made for My First Game Jam (summer 2023).

## IMPORTANT:
- Commit your changes before pulling any to not lose them! Or shash them, pull and then unstash.
- Godot doesn't offer a clean way to move scenes between projects, so all development ought to be done here.
- If you need to undo a commit, use "revert". Only "amend" if you haven't pushed it yet to avoid "temporal paradoxes".
